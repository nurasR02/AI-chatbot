# Pathlight

Your university path, without the guesswork.

Pathlight turns a student's field of study, target countries, budget, and constraints into a personalized, explained university application shortlist — built for LOCUS Hackathon 2026, Case 02 ("Personalized University Admissions Route").

## The problem

Students choosing between universities across multiple countries face wildly different costs, languages, exam systems, and deadlines, with no single tool that turns their situation into a concrete, prioritized plan. Generic search sites list everything with no personalization; a chatbot can invent facts it doesn't actually know.

## The solution

A structured, five-step questionnaire produces a profile. A deterministic scoring algorithm — not an LLM — filters and ranks real university programs against that profile, explains why each one fits, flags what to watch out for, and generates a single prioritized next action. Every factual claim (tuition, deadlines, requirements) is labeled with how confident the data actually is.

## Key features

- **Guided profile** — a progressive 5-step form instead of one long questionnaire.
- **Diagnosis** — strengths, constraints, and gaps read directly from the profile, plus a readiness view that is never framed as an admission probability.
- **Ranked recommendations** — a transparent, six-factor scoring algorithm with a visible score breakdown on every result.
- **What-If mode** — change budget or country preference and watch the shortlist and reasoning update live.
- **Comparison view** — side-by-side tradeoffs for selected programs, deliberately not a "best pick."
- **Roadmap** — a single pinned "next action," a readiness view, and a prioritized Now/Next/Later task list.
- **Saved programs** — bookmark and revisit options as the shortlist changes.
- **Data trust system** — every fact is labeled verified, needs-verification, or demo data.

## User journey

Landing → Profile → Diagnosis → Recommendations → Comparison → Roadmap → Next Action → Progress.

## Recommendation architecture

No LLM decides which universities appear. A plain TypeScript pipeline (`src/lib/engine/`) hard-filters impossible options (wrong field, wrong country, tuition far beyond budget), then scores everything that survives across six weighted factors (academic fit, interest fit, budget fit, requirement readiness, location fit, preference fit), then ranks by the weighted result. Explanation text is generated only from those already-computed numbers. Full specification: [`docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE.md`](docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE.md).

## AI usage

Claude is used in exactly one place: rephrasing already-computed explanation text into warmer prose, constrained by a prompt that forbids adding new facts, with the deterministic template text as an automatic, verified fallback when no API key is configured or the call fails. AI never selects which universities appear. Full detail: [`docs/AI_USAGE.md`](docs/AI_USAGE.md).

## Data sources and verification

Every tuition, deadline, requirement, and scholarship figure is labeled `verified` (confirmed against a specific official page), `needs_verification` (a plausible secondary source), or `demo_data` (estimated, no reliable source found) — rendered as a visible badge in the UI. Full per-university breakdown: [`docs/DATA_AND_TRUST.md`](docs/DATA_AND_TRUST.md).

## Tech stack

Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vitest. Claude API (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) for the optional explanation layer. No database — local persistence via `localStorage`, accessed through a `useSyncExternalStore`-based hook.

## Architecture

Full architecture, stack rationale, and folder map: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real values. Both are optional — the app runs fully functional without them:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=      # enables live AI rephrasing; falls back to templates if unset
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=        # optional override, defaults to claude-opus-5
```

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On Windows, double-clicking `START_HERE.bat` builds and runs a production instance and opens it in the browser automatically.

## Testing

```bash
npm test       # Vitest — recommendation engine, diagnosis, and roadmap logic
npm run lint   # ESLint
```

## Deployment

Deployed via Vercel. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data-flow model; no database or external service is required for a working deployment.

## Limitations

- Dataset covers Computer Science, Business, Engineering, Natural Sciences, and Humanities across 9 universities in the USA, Kazakhstan, and China. No Medicine or Arts program data was found for these institutions.
- No accounts or cross-device sync — state is per-browser (`localStorage`).
- The live AI rephrasing path requires a provisioned Anthropic API key; only the deterministic fallback has been exercised in this build.
